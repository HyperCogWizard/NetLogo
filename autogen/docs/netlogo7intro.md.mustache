The items in the table of contents highlighted in yellow are the
most important changes in NetLogo 7.0.0.

[TOC levels=2,3]

Note: in this document the term “clicking” is
synonymous with “left-clicking.” Right-clicking will be referred
to explicitly.

## Motivation

We interviewed many NetLogo users and one of the most desired updates
was a more modern User Interface (UI). In response to user feedback we
have made major changes to the UI for NetLogo 7.0.0. We plan to continue
modernizing NetLogo in future releases. Your feedback via the [NetLogo
Forum](https://forum.netlogo.org/) will help guide UI improvements.

### Overview of Visual Changes to the Interface Tab

The most obvious change is that interface elements (widgets) have
changed in appearance to a modern flat look. They are larger and more
legible. A new feature is color themes which affect the appearance of
the entire visual interface. They have been designed with visual
coherence in mind. Use the Tools-&gt;Color Themes menu to select Light,
Dark or Classic. For the Classic Color Theme the pre-7.0.0 widget colors
are used. In other regards it is the same as Light Mode. The Color Theme
also affects the appearance of the Info Tab and the Code Tab.

### Interface Elements (Widgets)

Buttons perform actions when clicked. The input widgets are: sliders,
switches, choosers and inputs. The output widgets are: monitors, plots
and the output area. Notes are used to add labels, instructions and
other information to the interface. Buttons and input widgets are
colored shades of blue. Output widgets are shades of grey. Widgets by
and large perform as they did in previous releases of NetLogo. A new
feature of the slider is a text box in which values can be added
directly. A new feature of the Notes is that the user can set both the
text color and the background color for both light and dark mode.

### Widget Sizes

In NetLogo 7 some widget sizes have been adjusted for greater
readability. The default height of sliders, switches, choosers, inputs,
monitors and plots has been increased. The image below shows some
widgets in their new sizes on the left, and the original/pre-NetLogo 7
sizes on the right.

<p><img src="./images/nl7intro/widgetsrelativesize.png" style="width:4.3in" /></p>

When you open a new model, widgets will appear by default in their new
(generally larger) sizes. Existing models will open with new style
widgets that retain their original size. Most widgets in the Models
Library have been converted the new sizes.

There is a tools menu item *Tools -&gt; Convert Widgets to New Sizes*,
that will make an automatic conversion. Click OK to resize the widgets
and change their placements. The button on the left will let you resize
the widgets without changing their location. Since redesigning
interfaces is an art, more work may be required to make the design meet
your personal standards, as indicated by the warning. The Edit -&gt;
Undo menu will let you undo all the widget conversions at once.

<p><img src="./images/nl7intro/converterwarning.png" style="width:4in"/></p>

You can also switch the size of an individual widget by clicking the
*Use old sizing* checkbox. This only holds for widgets that have
undergone a size change for NetLogo 7. The size of buttons, the output
area, and notes have remained the same.

<p><img src="./images/nl7intro/editslider.png" style="width:4.7in" /></p>

## New File Format

Models in NetLogo 7 have a new format which is extensible and makes it
easier to add new features to NetLogo. [The new file
format](https://github.com/NetLogo/NetLogo/wiki/XML-File-Format) follows
the XML format , and is compatible for any external tools for working
with XML. Models saved with this format .nlogox or .nlogox3d, rather
than .nlogo or .nlogo3d. All models going forward will use the new file
format. Existing model files, with the extension .nlogo or .nlogo3d, can
be opened in NetLogo 7 and will be automatically converted without loss
of information. However .nlogox files cannot be opened with previous
versions of NetLogo. Any tools users have created that rely on the
format of .nlogo files will need to be re-written.

## <mark>Tools in the NetLogo 7 Interface</mark>

### Overview: NetLogo Interface Tool Buttons and Dropdown menus.

The Interface Panel now includes four tool buttons which control the
meaning of user actions. They are the Interaction Tool, the Selection
Tool, the Edit Tool and the Delete Tool. The key motivations for these
tools are 1) to make user actions more discoverable and 2) to separate
actions needed to use an existing model from those used when creating or
modifying a model. There are also two pull-down menu tools, Add Widgets,
and Align Widgets.

One of the four tools or is always active unless the user is currently
adding a widget. The active tool appears darker than the others. From
left to right on the Interface Toolbar are the Add Widgets, and Align
Widgets pull-down menus, the Interaction Tool (a finger icon) Selection
Tool (a cursor with dotted box icon) the Edit Tool (a pencil icon) and
the Delete Tool (a garbage can icon).

### Interaction Tool

The Interaction Tool is for making direct use of widgets to run commands
and change global variables.

<p><img src="./images/nl7intro/interactiontool.png" style="width:3in" /></p>

The effect of clicking is widget specific, and is the same as in NetLogo
6.4.

#### Right-clicking

Users can Select, Edit and Delete widgets in interaction mode by
right-clicking and bringing up a menu. With Plots one can also Copy
Image, Export … and Clear. With the Output widget one can Copy
SelectedText and Export …. The View cannot be deleted. The available
options are Select, Edit, Copy View, Export View, Switch to 3D View,
Inspect Globals, Inspect a patch, and Inspect, Watch or Follow a turtle.

#### Ctrl-clicking or Cmd-clicking

Selection of a widget can be toggled on and off using Ctrl-click
(Windows and Linux) or Cmd-click (MacOs). This activates the Interaction
Tool.

#### Drag Select

One option that is not available with the Interaction Tool is using
Drag-Select to select one or more widgets. To Drag-Select first press
the Selection Tool. However Ctrl+Drag does work with the Interactions
tool.

#### Exiting 

Pressing the Selection, Editing or Deletion icons
exits the Interaction Tool. One can also activate the Selection
Tool by using Ctrl-Click (Windows or Linux) or Cmd-Click (macOS) on a
widget, or by using the Select option with the right-click pull-down
menu. Using the Edit or Delete option with the right-click pull-down
menu does not exit the Interaction Tool because they are “transient”
actions.

<p><img src="./images/nl7intro/widgetrightclick.png"
style="width:3.1in" /></p>

### Selection, Editing and Deletion Tools

These explicit tools are new for NetLogo 7, although they incorporate
behaviors associated with certain NetLogo 6.4. icons.

Each of these tools can be entered by pressing the appropriate icon.
When one of these tools is active widgets will be faintly dimmed to
indicate that they are not currently interactive, and all "forever"
buttons will halt. Each can be exited by selecting a different tool
icon. The Esc key will return you to the Interaction Tool. Moving the
focus to another context such as the Command Center, the Info Tab, or
the Code Tab will activate the Interaction Tool.

### Add Widgets Menu

This menu allows users to add widgets. This tool is entered by clicking
the “Add Widget” dropdown menu on the Interface toolbar and making a
widget selection. The movement of the mouse is accompanied by a light
image of the element and there is no cursor. Clicking places the element
in its current location. Right-clicking allows you to change the widget
type. You can also add a widget by right-clicking anywhere in the white
background. This brings up a menu, allowing you to select the widget
type and place the widget.

Once you complete the add widget action by clicking “OK” to insert the
element, or “Cancel” to abort the process the Interaction Tool is
active.

### Selection Tool

This tool allows users to select and subsequently edit or move an
element or change its size. Enter this tool by pressing the “Selection
Tool” icon on the Interface toolbar (cursor with dashed rectangle).

<p><img src="./images/nl7intro/selectedwidgets.png" style="width:3.2in" /></p>

#### Selecting

Press the “Selection Tool” Icon. Widgets will dim. Clicking on an
interface element selects it. A line border with square handles will
appear around the element to show it is selected. This will be black for
the Light Color Theme, and grey the Dark Color Theme. A widget can also
be selected by dragging a rectangle around it with your mouse or by
right-clicking a widget and choosing Select from the menu. You can
toggle selection and deselection by using Ctrl+click(Windows/Linux) /
Cmd+click(MacOS) an widget Any method of selecting one or more widgets
will activate the Selection Tool. Clicking the background area will
deselect any selected widgets. Dragging the mouse will move all selected
widget(s). You can also click and drag an individual widget before the
selection markers appear.

#### Selecting multiple items

You can select multiple interface elements at the same time by including
them in the rectangle you drag. Additional elements can also be added by
using the alternative methods.

#### Deselecting

An individual selected interface element can be selected by pressing
Ctrl+click(Windows/Linux) / Cmd+click(MacOS) or by right-clicking the
element and choosing “Unselect” from the popup menu. To deselect all
selected interface elements, click the mouse on the white background of
the Interface tab. The Selection Tool will remain active. Any method of
choosing a different tool will exit Selection tool.

The following actions require that at least widget is selected:

#### Moving

Select one or more widgets, then drag with your mouse to the new
location. You can use the arrow keys to move the widgets a small
increment right, left, up, or down. Using shift plus an arrow key
increases the increment. If you hold down the shift key while dragging,
the elements will move only straight up and down or straight left and
right. The items remain selected.

#### Resizing

Select the interface element, then drag the square “handles” in the
selection border. If multiple elements are selected the handles can be
dragged one at a time, and the items remain selected.

The following actions require that two or more elements already be
selected.

#### Aligning

If more than one element is
selected, clicking Align Widgets will display a popup menu of alignment
choices. Dragging the mouse to select an option and releasing it will
perform the alignment. The items remain selected.



#### Distributing

The Align Widgets menu also has options for
distributing widgets vertically or horizontally. The items remain
selected.

#### Stretching

The Align Widgets menu also has options for
stretching widgets to match other widgets to the right, left, top or
bottom. The items remain selected.

#### Widget Overlap

The actions of aligning, distributing or stretching
will not be completed if they would create a new overlap of widgets. Not
completing an action may result in unexpected behavior, but
protects users from other unexpected behavior, such as one widget
becoming completely hidden behind another.

<p><img src="./images/nl7intro/alignwidgetsmenu.png" style="width:3in" /></p>

### Editing Tool

This tool allows users to change the characteristics of an interface
element Enter this tool by pressing the “Editing Tool” Icon on the
Interface toolbar (a pencil).

*Editing*: Press the “Editing Tool” Icon and click on an element to edit
it. When the user completes editing a widget, the Editing Tool remains
active. Clicking another widget will edit it.

If an element is already selected you can press the editing icon to
activate Editing Tool and open the widget for editing. Clicking the Edit
icon when multiple items have already been selected deselects the items,
and enters the Edit tool. You can also begin editing by double-clicking
a selected element, or right-clicking an unselected element and choosing
“Edit” from the popup menu.

### Deletion Tool

This tool allows users to delete interface elements. Enter this tool by
pressing the “Deletion Tool” icon on the Interface toolbar (trashcan)
After an element is deleted the user is still in Deletion Tool and ready
to delete more items. The view cannot be deleted.

“Deletion Tool” Icon and click on an element to delete it. You can also
select the element or elements you want to delete, then press the
“Delete” to delete

<p><img src="./images/nl7intro/deletiontooldark.png" style="width:3.7in" /></p>

#### Deleting

Press the widget. You may also delete an element by right-clicking it
and choosing “Delete” from the popup menu. If you use this latter
method, it is not necessary to select the element first.

## Speed Slider

The speed slider is located in the Interface Toolbar. You can make the
model run faster by moving the slider to the right, or by clicking one
or more times on the “+“ button, and slower by moving the slider to the
left, or by clicking one or more times on the “-“ button. Twenty clicks
on the “-“ or “+“ button will move the slider thumb from the center to
its minimum or maximum rate. The increase or decrease in speed is not
linear with the amount the slider knob is moved.

<p><img src="./images/nl7intro/modelspeedslider.png" style="width:3in" /></p>

## The Color Picker

Color Swatches has been replaced by the [Color Picker](colorpicker.html),
a new, more powerful way of selecting colors

## Notifications

When the NetLogo team sends out a new notification message a banner will
appear below the Interface Toolbar with a brief message. If you click on
the button you will go to a web page that gives the full information of
all messages to date in reverse chronological order.

## The Info Tab

The changes to the Info Tab are purely visual. The Find and Edit icons
and the section headers have been updated, as has the Help Icon that is
visible when editing the Info Tab. 

<p><img src="./images/nl7intro/infotabtoolbaredithelp.png" style="width:4in" /></p>

These are the Info Tab color themes.

### Code Tab Toolbar

The Code Tab toolbar features new icons. Some preferences are now
settable through the new Code Tab preferences dialog.

<p><img src="./images/nl7intro/codetabtoolbar.png"
style="width:4in" /></p>

### Code Tab Preferences Dialog

<p><img src="./images/nl7intro/codetabpreferences.png" style="width:3in" /></p>

This dialog can be used to set global code tab preferences. “Auto
indent” previously used a checkbox on the Code Tab toolbar. “Show line
numbers” was previously part of the overall Preferences Dialog.

### Included Files

When an included (.nls) file tab is selected it becomes blue. An
included file tab is closed by clicking on the “x” on the right side of
the tab. (Previously the close button was in the toolbar.) An included
file tab includes a checkbox to open it in a separate code window, and a
Preferences button, which work as they do for the main Code Tab.

<p><img src="./images/nl7intro/codetabtoolbarwithnls.png" style="width:4in" /></p>

## Menu Items

### Preferences Dialog

This dialog lets you customize various NetLogo settings. On Windows and
Linux, it is opened with the Tools menu “Preferences...” item. For Macs,
it’s under the “NetLogo” menu and reads “Settings”.

NetLogo 7 includes some new NetLogo settings, and is reorganized to
place related items in proximity.

<p><img src="./images/nl7intro/netlogopreferences.png" style="width:5in" /></p>

Use the check boxes or pull-down menus to change the default preference
values. When you are done, click the OK button to save your changes, or
the Cancel button to revert the preferences to the state they were in
before you opened the dialog. Most preferences take effect immediately.
You must exit and re-open NetLogo for the preferences that indicate
“(restart required)” to take effect. There is one preference that only
takes effect when the user opens a new model, or re-opens the current
model, as indicated by the note “(model reload required)”.

Here is a brief description of the new and changed preferences.

Reload model on external changes: If you use an editor outside of
NetLogo to change the model or any included .nls files the model will be
reloaded.

<u>Enable logging</u>: Create a log file containing user actions. This
option can be useful for teachers.

(restart required)

If logging is enabled and a log directory is not specified by the next
preference the error message “Logging was enabled, but no log directory
was specified.” will appear.

<u>Directory to store logs</u>: Specifies the directory to which log
files will be written. You can type in the directory name, or select a
directory using the Browse… dialog.

(restart required)

If logging is enabled one of the following may happen.

- If you type in a non-existent directory you will see a dialog that
  says “The specified log directory does not exist, would you like to
  create it?” with options “Yes” and “No.”

- You must have write permission for the log directory, otherwise you
  will get the message “NetLogo does not have permission to write to the
  specified log directory.”

<u>Auto-focus text or tab with errors when model is compiled</u>: If
checked, NetLogo will bring you to the location of an error if one
occurs during compilation.

<u>Open code tab in separate window on startup</u>: When checked the
Code tab will appear in a separate window when NetLogo is opened.

<u>Bold widget names</u>: By default, widget names are not in bold, use
this option to make them bold.

(model reload required)

<u>UI Scale:</u> This option is for Linux only. It must be set to the
same value as your system UI scale or NetLogo will fail to resize its
visual components correctly.

Entering an improper value will produce the error message “UI Scale must
be a valid floating point number.”

The “Show line numbers” preference is now part of the Code Tab
Preferences Dialog.

### File -&gt; Manage Bundled Resources dialog

This dialog allows you to view, add, or remove files that are bundled
with the current NetLogo model. These files can be read during a model
run using the Resource Extension (see the documentation page for the
extension for more details).

## Tools Menu Changes 

The new menu items ‘Color Themes’, ‘Color Picker’ and ‘Convert Widgets
to New Sizes’ have been described in earlier sections.

The menu item ‘Color Swatches’ has been removed.

The Turtle Shapes Editor and the Link Shapes Editor have been updated,
as described below.

### Turtle Shapes Editor

The Turtle Shapes Editor now has some buttons near the top, for easier
use. A search field has been added so users can quickly search through
the model’s collection of turtle shapes.

<p><img src="./images/nl7intro/turtleshapeseditor.png"
style="width:3" /></p>

### Link Shapes Editor

The Link Shapes Editor now has some buttons near the top, and a search
field.

<p><img src="./images/nl7intro/linkshapeseditor.png" style="width:3in" /></p>

### Help Menu

The Help Menu now has a link to
the [NetLogo Forum](https://forum.netlogo.org/), a website to ask/answer
questions and have discussions about NetLogo.
